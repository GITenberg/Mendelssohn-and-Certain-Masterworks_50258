<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>In the compass of the present pamphlet it is impossible
to give more than a cursory survey of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
happy but extraordinarily crowded life. He was
only slightly less prolific a composer than such masters
as Bach, Mozart or Schubert, even if he did not reach
the altitude of their supreme heights. But irrespective of
the quality of much of his output, the sheer mass of it is
astounding, the more so when we consider the extent of his
travels and the unceasing continuity of his professional
and social activities, which immensely exceeded anything
of the kind in the career of Schubert or Bach. In
these few pages it has not been feasible to mention
more than a handful of his more familiar compositions
which happen, incidentally, to rank among his best. The
reader will find here neither a detailed record of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
endless comings and goings nor any originality
of approach or appraisal in the necessarily casual comments
on a few works. If the booklet encourages him to
listen with perhaps a fresh interest to certain long familiar
scores, now that a full century has passed since the
composer&rsquo;s death, its object will have been achieved.</p>

<h1 title="">Mendelssohn and Certain Masterworks</h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HERBERT F. PEYSER</p>
<p>In 1729&mdash;the year of Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;St. Matthew Passion&rdquo;&mdash;a
humble Jew of Dessau on the Elbe, Mendel by name,
became the father of a boy whom he called Moses.
Mendel was something of a scholar as the times went,
but desperately poor. He kept body and soul together by
running a small Hebrew day-school and transcribing the
Pentateuch. His infant son might know the pangs of
hunger but he should have the boon of a sound education.
The training was begun almost before the child
could walk. Mendel would rout him out of bed at three
or four on winter mornings, fortify him with a cup of
tea and carry him, wrapped in a shawl, to a public
seminary where he was put in charge of the learned
Rabbi David Frankel.</p>
<p>Moses showed himself an extraordinarily gifted pupil.
For one thing, he was consumed by a restless spirit of
inquiry. He set about making an exhaustive study of the
Scriptures, read voraciously, acquired languages with uncanny
facility and, before he was ten, composed Hebrew
verses. Nothing influenced him so deeply as Maimonides&rsquo;
&ldquo;The Guide of the Perplexed&rdquo;. But the intensity of his
intellectual occupation was such that he fell prey to a
nervous malady which deformed his spine for life. He
bore his ailment with the patience of Job and was never
heard to complain. &ldquo;If Maimonides weakened my body&rdquo;,
he had a habit of saying, &ldquo;has he not made ample atonement
by invigorating my soul with his sublime instructions?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>According to a traditional Jewish manner of forming
a surname Moses called himself &ldquo;Son of Mendel&rdquo;&mdash;in
German, &ldquo;Mendels Sohn&rdquo;&mdash;albeit he long alluded to
himself as &ldquo;Moses Dessauer&rdquo;. When Rabbi Frankel transferred
his activities to Berlin his disciple, though only
fourteen, followed him on foot. Hunger, sickness, deprivations,
bitter antagonisms, far from breaking the youth&rsquo;s
spirit, deepened his perceptions and broadened his vision.
He wrote and studied with fanatic zeal and in the fullness
of time developed into one of the greatest scholars
and philosophers of the age. The poet Lessing was one
of his intimates. His work, &ldquo;Phaedon, or the Immortality
of the Soul&rdquo;, gained such currency that it was translated
into every language of Europe.</p>
<p>Moses Mendelssohn endured without a murmur the
numberless hardships and disabilities to which the German
Jews of the period of Frederick the Great and his
tyrannical father were subjected. One of the most preposterous
of these regulations obliged every Jew when
he married to buy a certain amount of chinaware from
the royal porcelain factory in Berlin, whether he needed
it or not. Not even the choice of articles was left to him,
so long as the factory manager decided the place was
overstocked. In this way Moses Mendelssohn when in
1762 he took to wife Fromet, daughter of Abraham Gugenheim,
of Hamburg, acquired twenty life-sized china
apes which had been found unsaleable. Much later the
apes became valued family heirlooms.</p>
<p>The domestic happiness and tranquility he had never
known in his youth were at last to be the philosopher&rsquo;s
portion. Moses and Fromet had a considerable family,
though only six of the children&mdash;three sons and three
daughters&mdash;survived to maturity. Moses himself died in
Berlin at 57. Longevity, as it proved, was not to be a
trait of the Mendelssohns.</p>
<p>Of the three sons the second, Abraham, was destined
to play a role in musical history. True, he was not himself
a trained musician although he had very sensitive
artistic instincts; and he labored under a mild sense of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
inferiority, which used to find expression in his whimsical
phrase: &ldquo;Formerly I was the son of my father, now I
am the father of my son&rdquo;. In any case he had not to
endure anything like the paternal struggles and poverty.
Of his boyhood not much is known. But in his twenties
he was sent to Paris and worked for a time as cashier in
the bank of M. Fould. When he returned to Germany he
entered a banking business founded in Berlin and Hamburg
by his brother, Joseph. It was possibly on his trip
home that he met his future wife, Leah Salomon. If
marriages are made in heaven this match assuredly could
boast a celestial origin! Leah Salomon was an wholly
unusual woman. She came of a Berlin family of wealth
and position, she was exquisitely sensitive and cultured
and, although she strictly limited her singing and playing
to the home circle, was a musician of gifts quite out of
the ordinary. Moreover, she drew, was an accomplished
linguist (she even read Homer in Greek, though only in
the privacy of her boudoir, lest anyone suspect her of
&ldquo;immodesty&rdquo;), and dressed with studied simplicity.
Among Leah&rsquo;s elaborate virtues was her tireless devotion
to her mother. She kept house for her and granted her
a substantial income.</p>
<p>Small wonder that such a union was blessed with exceptional
offspring. Of the four children of Abraham
and Leah Mendelssohn, Fanny C&auml;cilie, Jakob Ludwig
Felix and Rebecka saw the light at Hamburg, in the
order named. The youngest, Paul, came not long after
the family had removed to Berlin. It may not be inappropriate
to call briefly into the picture at this point Leah&rsquo;s
brother, Jacob Salomon Bartholdy, if for no other reason
than to account for a surname which formed an adjunct
to part of the Mendelssohn family, including the
composer. Salomon, a distinguished art critic who spent
his later years in Rome as Prussian consul-general, had
embraced Protestantism (despite a traditional curse
launched by his mother) and adopted the name &ldquo;Bartholdy&rdquo;
after &ldquo;the former proprietor of a garden belonging
to the family&rdquo;&mdash;a garden which subsequently passed
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
into the hands of Abraham Mendelssohn. It was Salomon
Bartholdy who at length persuaded his brother-in-law
to procure for his children what Heinrich Heine
had called &ldquo;a ticket of admission to European culture&rdquo;&mdash;in
short, conversion to the Christian faith. To distinguish
between the converted members of the family and those
who clung to their old belief &ldquo;Bartholdy&rdquo; was henceforth
affixed to &ldquo;Mendelssohn&rdquo;. In time, Abraham and
Leah followed their children into the Lutheran faith,
Leah adding to her own name those of Felicia and
Paulina, in allusion to her sons.</p>
<p>Felix was born on Friday, Feb. 3, 1809, at 14 Grosse
Michaelisstrasse, Hamburg. Long afterwards the place
was marked by a commemorative tablet above the entrance,
a tribute from Jenny Lind and her husband.
Curiously enough, the violinist Ferdinand David, Felix&rsquo;s
friend and associate of later days, was born under the
same roof scarcely a year after. Hamburg became an
unpleasant place during the occupation by Napoleon&rsquo;s
troops and in 1811, soon after the birth of Rebecka, the
family escaped in disguise to Berlin where Abraham, at
his own expense, outfitted a company of volunteers. The
Mendelssohns took up residence in a house belonging to
the widow Fromet. It was situated in what was then an
attractive quarter of north-eastern Berlin, on a street
called the Neue Promenade that had houses on one side
and a tree-bordered canal on the other. It offered a
spacious playground for the children and the singer,
Eduard Devrient, recalled seeing Felix play marbles or
touch-and-run with his comrades.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Abraham Mendelssohn, having severed the partnership
with his brother, started a banking business of his own
which soon prospered famously. Somehow even the
myriad cares of running a bank did not prevent the
father from scrupulously overseeing the education of his
sons and daughters. If the young people were virtually
bedded on roses, Abraham was of too strong a character
and, indeed, too much of a martinet not to subject them
to the discipline of a carefully ordered routine. Wealth
and ease did not cause him to forget the privations and
the conflicts which helped to forge the greatness of his
own father&rsquo;s soul. His children need not hunger, they
need not be denied opportunities to develop what talents
nature had bestowed on them. But given such opportunities
they must labor unremittingly to make the most
of them. They had to be up and about at five in the
morning and, shortly after, repair to their lessons. Felix
always looked forward to Sundays when he could sleep
late! In some ways one is reminded of the manner
Leopold Mozart supervised the training of Wolfgang and
Nannerl. If Abraham Mendelssohn was not, like Father
Mozart, a practising musician, he had an artistic insight
which nobody valued higher than Felix himself. &ldquo;I am
often unable to understand&rdquo;, he wrote his father when
he was already a world celebrity, &ldquo;how it is possible to
have so accurate a judgment about music without being
a technical musician and if I could only say what I
feel in the same clear and intelligent manner that you
always do, I should certainly never make another confused
speech as long as I live&rdquo;. It is easy to believe that
some of the adoration Felix felt for his father above all
others grew out of his unbounded respect for the older
man&rsquo;s intellectual superiority.</p>
<p>Business connected with war indemnities associated
with the Napoleonic conflicts obliged Abraham in 1816
to go to Paris and on this journey he took his family
with him. Felix and Fanny were placed for piano instruction
under a Madame Marie Bigot de Morogues and both
appear to have profited. Their first piano lessons had been
given them at home by their mother who, in the beginning
restricted them to five minute periods so that they ran
no risk of growing weary or restive. Fanny no less than
her brother disclosed an unusual feeling for the keyboard
at an early age and even when she was born Leah noted
that the infant seemed to have &ldquo;Bach fugue fingers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When the Mendelssohns returned to Berlin the young
people&rsquo;s education was begun systematically. General
tuition was administered by Karl Heyse, father of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
novelist; the painter, R&ouml;sel, taught drawing, for which
Felix exhibited a natural aptitude from the first; Ludwig
Berger, a pupil of Clementi&rsquo;s, developed the boy&rsquo;s piano
talents, Carl Wilhelm Henning gave him violin lessons
and Goethe&rsquo;s friend, Carl Zelter, taught thorough-bass
and composition. Nor were the social graces neglected.
Felix learned to swim, to ride, to fence, to dance. Dancing,
indeed, was one of his passions all his life. Father Mendelssohn
always found time to supervise his children&rsquo;s
studies and to guide their accomplishments. For that
matter he never considered his sons and daughters&mdash;even
when they grew up&mdash;too old for his discipline; and,
certainly, Felix welcomed rather than resented it.</p>
<p>On Oct. 28, 1818, the boy made his first public appearance
as pianist. The occasion was a concert given by a
horn virtuoso, Joseph Gugel. Felix collaborated in a trio
for piano and two horns, by Joseph W&ouml;lfl. He earned,
we are told, &ldquo;much applause&rdquo;. But Abraham, though
pleased, was not the man to have his head turned by
displays of precocity, shallow compliments or noisy acclamations.
Neither did Zelter flatter his pupil on his
never-failing facility. No problem seemed excessive for
the boy, who could read orchestral scores, transpose,
improvise&mdash;what you will. &ldquo;Come, come&rdquo;, Zelter would
grumble contemptuously, as if these feats were the most
natural thing in the world, &ldquo;genius ought to be able to
dress the hair of a sow and make curls of it!&rdquo; Yet to
Goethe he made no effort to conceal his satisfaction.
&ldquo;Felix is a good and handsome boy, merry and obedient&rdquo;,
he confided in a letter; &ldquo;his father has brought him up
the proper way.... He plays piano like a real devil and
is not in the least backward on string instruments...&rdquo;.
And the crusty contrapuntist saw to it that the ten-year-old
genius entered the Singakademie and sang among the
altos where he could learn to know, inside and out, works
by Palestrina, Bach, Handel and lesser masters, distinguish
between styles and observe the minutest technicalities of
fugal construction.</p>
<p>It was only natural that Felix should, at this stage,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
have tried his own hand at composition. He wrote to his
father, in Paris, asking for music paper. Abraham took
the request as the text for a mild sermon: &ldquo;You, my dear
Felix&rdquo;, he admonished his son, &ldquo;must state exactly what
kind of music paper you wish to have&mdash;ruled or not
ruled; and if the former you must say distinctly <i>how</i> it is
to be ruled. When I went into the shop the other day
to buy some, I found that I did not know myself what
I wanted to have. Read over your letter before you send
it off and ascertain whether, if addressed to yourself,
you could execute the commission contained in it&rdquo;.
Sooner or later he must have gotten his music paper for
in 1820, when Felix began to compose, it is figured that
he wrote fifty or sixty movements of one sort or another,
solo and part songs, a cantata and a comedy.
In every instance his methodical training caused him to
inscribe the work with the exact date and place of its
composition&mdash;a practice which saved no end of doubt
and conjecture in later years, the more so as Felix
remained quite as systematic his life long. These scores
(of which he kept a painstaking catalogue) are headed
in many cases with the mysterious formula &ldquo;L.v.g.G.&rdquo; or
&ldquo;H.d.m.&rdquo;, which though never satisfactorily deciphered,
reappears again and again in his output.</p>
<p>Some of these compositions, together with several by
Fanny were dispatched to Abraham in Paris. The father
was particularly pleased with a fugue and wrote home:
&ldquo;I like it well; it is a great thing. I should not have
expected him to set to work in such good earnest so
soon, for such a fugue requires reflection and perseverance&rdquo;.
He was perturbed over his daughter&rsquo;s composing,
though he appreciated her talent. It was well enough,
he declared, for Felix to take up music as a profession
but Fanny must bear in mind that a woman&rsquo;s place is in
the home. As a warning example he points to the sad
end of Madame Bigot, who busied herself professionally
with music and now is dead of consumption!</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>In 1821 there took place in Berlin an event which
stirred the musical world of Germany to its depths&mdash;the
first performance of Weber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo;. The
composer, who supervised the rehearsals, was generally
accompanied by his young friend and pupil, Julius
Benedict. One day while escorting his master to the
theatre, Benedict noticed a boy of about eleven or twelve
running toward them with gestures of hearty greeting.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Felix Mendelssohn!&rdquo; exclaimed Weber delightedly,
and he at once introduced the lad to Benedict, who had
heard of the remarkable talents of the little musician
even before coming to Berlin. &ldquo;I shall never forget the
impression of that day on beholding that beautiful youth,
with the auburn hair clustering in ringlets round his
shoulders, the look of his brilliant, clear eyes and the
smile of innocence and candour on his lips&rdquo;, wrote
Benedict much later in his &ldquo;Sketch of the Life and Works
of the late Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy&rdquo;. Felix wanted
the pair to visit the Mendelssohn home at once, but as
Weber was expected at the opera house he asked Benedict
to go in his stead. &ldquo;Felix took me by the hand and
made me run a race till we reached his house. Up he
went briskly to the drawing-room where, finding his
mother, he exclaimed: &lsquo;Here is a pupil of Weber&rsquo;s, who
knows a great deal of his music of the new opera. Pray,
mamma, ask him to play it for us&rsquo;; and so, with an
irresistible impetuosity, he pushed me to the pianoforte
and made me remain there until I had exhausted all the
store of my recollections&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A more spectacular event in Felix&rsquo;s young life was
his first visit to Goethe, in Weimar, the same year. It
was Zelter who, anxious to acquaint the poet with his
prodigious young pupil, had engineered the meeting.
Felix had never gone anywhere without his parents and
the family was not a little concerned about this expedition.
He was plied with no end of advice before setting
out, told how to behave at table, how to eat, how to talk,
how to listen. &ldquo;When you are with Goethe, I advise you
to open your eyes and ears wide&rdquo;, admonished Fanny;
&ldquo;and after you come home, if you can&rsquo;t repeat every
word that fell from his mouth, I will have nothing more
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
to do with you!&rdquo; His mother, for her part, wrote to Aunt
Henrietta (the celebrated family spinster, &ldquo;Tante Jette&rdquo;):
&ldquo;Just fancy that the little wretch is to have the good luck
of going to Weimar with Zelter for a short time. You
can imagine what it costs me to part from the dear child
even for a few weeks. But I consider it such an advantage
for him to be introduced to Goethe, to live under the
same roof with him and receive the blessing of so great
a man! I am also glad of this little journey as a change
for him; for his impulsiveness sometimes makes him work
harder than he ought to at his age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mendelssohns need not have worried. The old
poet took the boy to his heart from the first. Nor was
Felix remiss about communicating his impressions. &ldquo;Now,
stop and listen, all of you&rdquo;, he writes home in an early
missive which forms part of one of the finest series of
letters any of the great composers has left posterity.
&ldquo;Today is Tuesday. On Saturday the Sun of Weimar,
Goethe, arrived. We went to church in the morning and
heard half of Handel&rsquo;s 100th Psalm. After this I went
to the &lsquo;Elephant&rsquo;, where I sketched the house of Lucas
Cranach. Two hours afterwards, Professor Zelter came
and said: &lsquo;Goethe has come&mdash;the old gentleman&rsquo;s come!&rsquo;
and in a minute we were down the steps and in Goethe&rsquo;s
house. He was in the garden and was just coming around
a corner. Isn&rsquo;t it strange, dear father, that was exactly
how you met him! He is very kind, but I don&rsquo;t think
any of the pictures are like him....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every morning I get a kiss from the author of &lsquo;Faust&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Werther&rsquo; and every afternoon two kisses from my
friend and father Goethe. Think of that! It does not
strike me that his figure is imposing; he is not much
taller than father; but his look, his language, his name&mdash;they
are imposing. The amount of sound in his voice is
wonderful and he can shout like ten thousand warriors.
His hair is not yet white, his step is firm, his way of speaking
mild....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felix made much music for the poet&rsquo;s enjoyment.
Every day he played him something of Bach, Mozart,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Beethoven or compositions of his own (he had even
brought some of Fanny&rsquo;s songs for Goethe&rsquo;s daughter-in-law,
who had a pretty voice). &ldquo;Every afternoon&rdquo;, wrote
Felix, &ldquo;Goethe opens the Streicher piano with the words:
&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard you at all today; make a little noise for
me&rsquo;; then he sits beside me and when I am finished (I
usually improvise), I beg him for a kiss or else I just take
it!&rdquo; Once Felix played a Bach fugue and suffered a slip
of memory. Nothing daunted he went on improvising at
considering length. The poet noticed nothing! At other
times he would sit by the window listening, the image of
a Jupiter Tonans, his old eyes flashing. And when the
boy finally left Weimar Goethe missed him sorely. &ldquo;Since
your departure&rdquo;, he lamented, &ldquo;my piano is silent. A
solitary attempt to waken it to life was a failure. I hear,
indeed, much talk about music but that is only a sorry
diversion&rdquo;. A certain classical symmetry and a halcyon
beauty in the boy&rsquo;s music and in his performances seem
to have appealed to a deep-seated element of the poet&rsquo;s
nature. When some time afterwards Felix dedicated a
quartet to him, Goethe accepted it with a letter of fulsome
praise. Yet when poor Schubert about the same
period sent him a number of his finest Goethe settings
the Olympian did not even deign to acknowledge them!</p>
<p>Leah Mendelssohn, delighted with the letters Felix was
writing from Weimar, proudly forwarded them to Aunt
Jette, in Paris. &ldquo;If God spare him&rdquo;, replied that worthy
person, &ldquo;his letters will in long years to come create the
deepest interest. Take care of them as of a holy relic;
indeed, they are already sacred as the effusion of so pure
and child-like a mind. You are a happy mother and you
must thank Providence for giving you such a son. He is
an artist in the highest sense, rare talents combined with
the noblest, tenderest heart....&rdquo; The good woman spoke
prophetically! Not all of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s letters have been
preserved and some of them were withheld out of scruples
which today are rather difficult to appreciate. Whether
the anti-Semitic excesses of the Nazi regime spared those
portions of the correspondence not previously given to
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the world is still unknown. Perhaps we shall never read
it in all its inundating fullness. There were times in his
short life when he wrote as many as thirty-five letters in
one day! At any rate, those we have are precious.</p>
<p>It must not be imagined that Felix&rsquo;s numerous boyhood
compositions served student ends primarily. This
early spate of symphonies, concertos, songs, piano and
organ pieces, chamber music and what not furnished matter
for regular family musicales. The Mendelssohns had
for some time been in the habit of holding miscellaneous
concerts on alternate Sunday mornings in the big dining
room of the house on the Neue Promenade. In these the
young people participated and invariably some work or
other by Felix made up a part of the program. Felix and
Fanny usually played piano, Rebecka sang, Paul played
cello. Felix also conducted and had at first to be placed
on a stool so that his small figure could be seen. Little
operas and operettas varied the programs, the boy being
the author of four of them. These &ldquo;operas&rdquo; were not
given in costume or with any attempt at dramatic,
action. The characters were duly assigned and sung, but
the dialogue was read and the chorus sat grouped around
a table. The listeners offered their opinions freely, Zelter
(who never missed one of these events) commending or
criticising, as the case might be.</p>
<p>On Felix&rsquo;s fifteenth birthday, Zelter suddenly rose and,
&ldquo;in masonic phraseology&rdquo;, promoted his pupil from the
grade of &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;assistant&rdquo;, adding that
he welcomed him to this new rank &ldquo;in the name of Mozart,
of Haydn and of old Bach&rdquo;. This last name was significant.
For a little earlier the boy had received as a Christmas
present a score of the &ldquo;St. Matthew Passion&rdquo; transcribed
by Zelter&rsquo;s express permission from a manuscript
preserved in the Singakademie. Henceforth the &ldquo;assistant&rdquo;
was to immerse himself in this music and it was the exhaustive
study of the treasurous score which resulted a
few years later in the historic revival of the work an
exact century after its first production under Bach&rsquo;s own
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The summer of 1824 Felix for the first time saw the
sea. His father took him and Rebecka to Dobberan, on
the Baltic, a bathing resort in the neighborhood of Rostock.
Here he received those first marine impressions
which in due course were to shape themselves musically
in the &ldquo;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fingal&rsquo;s
Cave&rdquo; Overtures. For the moment, the scope of this inspiration
was less ambitious. He wrote for the military
band at the local casino an overture for wind instruments
(&ldquo;Harmoniemusik&rdquo;), which stands in his output as Op.
24. It is sweetly romantic music, with a dulcet <i>andante
con moto</i> introduction that has a kind of family resemblance
to the softer phraseology of Weber, a spirited,
vivacious <i>allegro</i> forming the main body of the piece.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;Harmoniemusik&rdquo; Overture was only an incident
of the creative activity marking the year 1824. The
chief composition of the time was the Symphony in C
minor, which ranks as Mendelssohn&rsquo;s First. Actually,
it is his thirteenth in order of writing, though for
conventional purposes the preceding twelve (for strings)
may pass for juvenile efforts. We may as well record
here that, irrespective of the dates of the composition,
the official order of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s symphonies is as
follows: The Symphony-Cantata in B flat (the so-called
&ldquo;Hymn of Praise&rdquo;, dated 1840) stands as No. 2, the
A minor (&ldquo;Scotch&rdquo;), written between 1830 and 1842,
as No. 3, the A major (&ldquo;Italian&rdquo;), composed in 1833, as
No. 4, and the &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; one in D minor, known as
the &ldquo;Reformation Symphony&rdquo; (1830-32), as No. 5.</p>
<p>The Mendelssohn family was outgrowing the old home
on the Neue Promenade and late in the summer of 1825
Abraham bought that house on Leipziger Strasse which
was henceforth to be inalienably associated with the composer.
If it had its drawbacks in winter the spacious edifice
with its superb garden (once a part of the Tiergarten)
was ideal at all other seasons. The so-called &ldquo;Garden
House&rdquo; was one of its most attractive features and became
the scene of those unforgettable Sunday concerts
where a number of new-minted masterpieces were first
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
brought to a hearing. The young people published a
household newspaper, in summer called the &ldquo;Garden
Times&rdquo;, in winter the &ldquo;Tea and Snow Times&rdquo;. Pen, ink
and paper were conveniently placed and every guest was
encouraged to write whatever occurred to him and
deposit it in a box, the contributions being duly printed
in the little sheet. These guests included the cream of the
intellectual, social and artistic life of Europe who
chanced to be in Berlin. It was a point of honor to be
invited to the Mendelssohn residence.</p>
<p>To this period belongs Felix&rsquo;s operatic effort &ldquo;Die
Hochzeit des Camacho&rdquo; (&ldquo;Camacho&rsquo;s Wedding&rdquo;). The
text, by Karl Klingemann, a Hanoverian diplomat who
played a not inconsiderable role in Mendelssohn&rsquo;s life,
was based on an episode from &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo;. The
story has to do with the mock suicide of the student,
Basilio, to rescue his beloved from the wealthy Camacho.
Possibly the little work would never have been written
but for the ambitions of Leah Mendelssohn to see
her son take his place among the successful opera composers
of the day. Having embarked upon the scheme
Felix went about it with his usual zeal. But the piece
was played exactly once, and in a small playhouse, not
at the big opera. Although there were many calls for
the composer he seems to have sensed a defeat and left
the theatre early. It was not long before he lost interest
in the work altogether.</p>
<p>However, better things were at hand to obliterate the
memory of the check suffered by &ldquo;Camacho&rsquo;s Wedding&rdquo;.
For we are now on the threshold of the composer&rsquo;s first
mature masterworks. It must be understood that there was
really no relation between Mendelssohn&rsquo;s years and the
extraordinary creations of his adolescence. In point of
fact, his creative mastery at the age of sixteen and
seventeen is maturity arrived at before its time. That
preternatural development, as remarkable in its way as
Mozart&rsquo;s, is the true answer to the problem why the later
creations of Mendelssohn show relatively so little advance
over the early ones. We can hardly believe, for instance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
that the F sharp minor Capriccio for piano or the Octet
could have been finer if written twenty years after
they were. How many not familiar with the respective
dates of composition could gather from the music itself
that the incidental pieces fashioned for the &ldquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; by royal command came fully seventeen
years after the immortal Overture? The whole might
have been created at one sitting, so undiscoverable is any
sign of cleavage.</p>
<p>The Octet for strings, finished in the autumn of 1825
represents, perhaps, the finest thing Mendelssohn had
written up to that point. It is a masterpiece of glistening
tone painting, exquisite in its mercurial grace and color,
imaginative delicacy and elfin lightness. The unity of
the whole is a marvel. But the pearl of the work is the
Scherzo in G minor, a page as airy and filamentous as
Mendelssohn&mdash;whose scherzos are, perhaps, his most
matchless achievements&mdash;was ever to write. Not even
the most fairylike passages in the &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rdquo; excel it.</p>
<p>Before passing on to the last-named, however, we must
not fail to signalize the &ldquo;Trumpet&rdquo; Overture, composed
about the same time (which Abraham Mendelssohn liked
so much that he said he should like to hear it on his deathbed);
the Quintet, Op. 18, the Sonata, Op. 6, the songs
of Op. 8 and 9, the unfailingly popular Prelude and
Fugue in E minor, of Op. 35. Let us not be confused, incidentally,
by opus numbers in Mendelssohn which have as
little to do with priority of composition as they have in
the case of Schubert.</p>
<p>Felix and Fanny read Shakespeare in translations of
Schlegel and Tieck. Their particular favorite was the
&ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo;. In August 1826, in the
delightful garden of the Leipziger Strasse home the youth
of seventeen signed the score of an Overture to the fantastic
comedy which, as much as anything he was
to write, immortalized his name. The famous friend of
the family, Adolph Bernhard Marx, claimed to have
given Felix certain musical suggestions. Be this as it may,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the Overture was something new under the sun and not a
measure of it has tarnished in the course of an odd 130
years. It was first performed as a piano duet and shortly
afterwards played by an orchestra at one of the Sunday
concerts in the garden house.</p>
<p>Felix entered the University of Berlin in 1826 and
offered as his matriculation essay a translation in verse
of Terence&rsquo;s &ldquo;Andria&rdquo;. Nevertheless, he seems to have
had no time to bother about a degree. Music was absorbing
him completely, especially his weekly rehearsals
of Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;St. Matthew Passion&rdquo; with a small choir.
The more intimately he penetrated into this mighty work
the keener became his desire to produce it at the Singakademie.
Together with his friend, Eduard Devrient,
he divulged his scheme to Zelter, only to be rebuffed.
Spurred by the energetic Devrient he returned again and
again to the attack, till Zelter finally weakened. Having
carried the day Mendelssohn left the Singakademie jubilantly
exclaiming to the elated Devrient: &ldquo;To think that
it should be an actor and a Jew, to give this great Christian
work back to the world!&rdquo; It was the only recorded
occasion on which Mendelssohn alluded to his Hebraic
origin.</p>
<p>Three performances were given of the &ldquo;St. Matthew
Passion&rdquo; at the Singakademie&mdash;the first on March 11,
1829, a century almost to a day since the original production
in the Leipzig Thomaskirche. Mendelssohn conducted
the first two. It was the real awakening of
the world to the grandeur of Bach, the true beginning of
a movement which has continued undiminished right up
to the present. Fanny spoke more truly than perhaps she
realized when she declared that &ldquo;the year 1829 is likely
to form an epoch in the annals of music&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Scarcely had Mendelssohn restored the &ldquo;St. Matthew
Passion&rdquo; to the world than he left Berlin for the first of
those ten trips he was to take to the country that was to
become his true spiritual home. Abraham Mendelssohn
having finally decided his son might safely adopt music
as a means of livelihood resolved to let him travel for
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
three years in order to gain experience, extend his artistic
reputation and settle on the scene of his activities. Felix
was not averse to the idea. Already he was feeling some
of those pin-pricks of hostility which Berlin, for reasons
of jealousy or latent anti-Semitism was to direct against
him in years to come. It was Moscheles who counseled
a visit to London, where another friend, Klingemann,
filled a diplomatic post.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s first Channel crossing was not calculated
to put him in a pleasant frame of mind. He was seasick,
he had fainting fits, he quarrelled with the steward and
solemnly cursed that &ldquo;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&rdquo;
Overture he had composed scarcely a year earlier. The
boat trip lasted almost three days! Luckily his friends had
found him comfortable quarters in London, at 103 Great
Portland Street. At once it developed that he and London
were predestined for each other. The metropolis both
appalled and enchanted him. &ldquo;It is fearful! It is maddening!&rdquo;,
he wrote home; &ldquo;I am quite giddy and confused.
London is the grandest and most complicated monster
on the face of the earth. How can I compress into a
letter what I have been three days seeing? I hardly remember
the chief events and yet I must not keep a diary,
for then I should see less of life.... Things roll and whirl
round me and carry me along as in a vortex&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He had arrived at the height of the season. The wife
of Moscheles took him about in a carriage (&ldquo;me in my
new suit, of course!&rdquo;) He went to the opera and to
the theatre, saw Kemble in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and was incensed
at the way Shakespeare was cut. Still &ldquo;the people here
like me for the sake of my music and respect me for it
and this delights me immensely&rdquo;. He made his first London
appearance with the Philharmonic on May 25, 1829,
and even at the rehearsal found two hundred listeners
on hand, &ldquo;chiefly ladies&rdquo;. The program contained his
C minor Symphony, though later an orchestrated version
of the scherzo from the Octet was substituted for the
original minuet. J. B. Cramer led Mendelssohn to the
stage &ldquo;as if I were a young lady&rdquo;. &ldquo;Immense applause&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
greeted him. This was soon to be an old story. When people
spied him in the audience at a concert someone was
sure to shout: &ldquo;There is Mendelssohn!&rdquo;; whereupon others
would applaud and exclaim: &ldquo;Welcome to him!&rdquo; In the
end Felix found no other way to restore quiet than to
mount the stage and bow.</p>
<p>He played piano for the first time in London at the
Argyll Rooms on May 30. His offering was Weber&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Concertst&uuml;ck&rdquo; and he caused a stir by performing it
without notes. One might say he was heard <i>before</i> the
concert&mdash;for he had gone to the hall to try a new instrument
several hours earlier but, finding it locked, seated
himself at an old one and improvised for a long time to
be suddenly roused from his revery by the noise of the
arriving audience. Whereupon he dashed off to dress for
the matinee in &ldquo;very long white trousers, brown silk
waistcoat, black necktie and blue dress coat&rdquo;. Not long
afterwards he gave concerts with Moscheles and with the
singer, Henrietta Sontag. The Argyll Rooms were so
crowded that &ldquo;ladies might be seen among the double
basses, between bassoons and horns and even seated on a
kettle drum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>London life, for that matter, seemed made to order for
Felix, the more so as he was received with open arms by
those influential personages to whom he brought letters
of introduction. Yet the whole spirit of London was vastly
to his taste. Writing later from Italy he confided to
his sister that, for all the luminous atmosphere of
Naples, &ldquo;London, that smoky nest, is fated to be now
and ever my favorite residence. My heart swells when
I even think of it&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The admiration was mutual! England of that age
(and for years to come) adored Mendelssohn quite as
it had Handel a century earlier and peradventure even
more than it did Haydn and Weber. Musically, the nation
made itself over in his image. And Felix loved the rest
of the country as he loved its metropolis. The London
season ended, he went on a vacation in July, 1829,
to Scotland, accompanied by Klingemann. The travelers
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
stopped first at Edinburgh, where they heard the Highland
Pipers and visited Holyrood Palace. Like any conventional
tourist Felix saw the apartments where Mary
Stuart lived and Rizzio was murdered, inspected the
chapel in which Mary was crowned but now &ldquo;open to
the sky and ... everything ruined and decayed; I think
I found there the beginning of my &lsquo;Scotch&rsquo; Symphony&rdquo;.
And he set down sixteen bars of what became the slow
introduction in A minor. It was to be some time, however,
before the symphony took its conclusive shape. If Holyrood
quickened his fancy &ldquo;one of the Hebrides&rdquo; (which
he saw a few days later) struck even brighter sparks from
his imagination. A rowboat trip to Fingal&rsquo;s Cave inspired
him to twenty bars of music &ldquo;to show how extraordinarily
the place affected me&rdquo;, as he wrote to his family. He
elaborated the overture&mdash;than which he did nothing
greater&mdash;in his own good time and recast it before
it satisfied him. For in the first form of this marine mood
picture, he missed &ldquo;train oil, salt fish and seagulls&rdquo;.
Yet the twenty bars he set down on the spot form its main
subject.</p>
<p>Back in London his mind was occupied with numerous
compositions, among them the first stirrings of the
&ldquo;Scotch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; Symphonies and the
&ldquo;Hebrides&rdquo; Overture. But before developing these he
wanted to write an organ piece for Fanny&rsquo;s marriage to
the painter, Wilhelm Hensel (whom Leah Mendelssohn
had put on a five years&rsquo; &ldquo;probation&rdquo; before she consented
to give him her daughter&rsquo;s hand!); and a household
operetta for the approaching silver wedding of
his parents. Klingemann wrote the libretto of this piece
(&ldquo;Heimkehr aus der Fremde&rdquo;, which the critic Chorley
in 1851 Englished as &ldquo;Son and Stranger&rdquo;). It contained
special roles for Fanny, Rebecka, Devrient and Hensel&mdash;the
last-named limited to one incessantly repeated note,
because he was so desperately unmusical.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p><span class="lr"><i>Hebrides, August 7, 1829.</i></span></p>
<p><i>... in order to make you understand how extraordinarily the
Hebrides affected me, the following came into my mind there:</i></p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Felix returned to Berlin for the parental festivities.
But Fanny&rsquo;s wedding he missed, having injured his leg
in a carriage accident and being laid up for two months.
He might, had he chosen, have accepted a chair of music
at the Berlin University in 1830, but he preferred to continue
his travels. It seemed almost a matter of routine
that he should stop off at Weimar to greet Goethe once
more. He may or may not have suspected that he was
never to see the poet again. Another friend he visited
was Julius Schubring, rector of St. George&rsquo;s Church in
Dessau. N&uuml;rnberg, Munich, Salzburg, the Salzkammergut
and Linz were stations on the way to Vienna, where
his enjoyment was poisoned by the depressing level of
musical life and the shocking popular neglect of masters
like Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. He made a side
trip to nearby Pressburg to witness the coronation of
the Austrian crown prince as King of Hungary. The
most exciting incident of the day was the smashing of
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s high hat by a spectator whose view it
obstructed!</p>
<p>Italy was another story. &ldquo;The whole country had
such a festive air&rdquo;, he wrote in one of the first of
those Italian letters which are among the gems of his
correspondence, &ldquo;that I seemed to feel as if I were myself
a prince making his grand entry&rdquo;. To be sure, there
was not much music worth listening to and he was horrified
by some of the things he heard in the churches. But
there were the great masters of painting, there was the
beauty of the countryside, the unnumbered attractions of
Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples, the fascination
of Italian life and the charm of the Italian people.
He heard the Holy Week musical services in the Sistine
Chapel with works of Palestrina, Allegri and lesser men;
wrote long and detailed letters to Zelter about the technical
aspects of church singing in Rome, composed
industriously, saw his boyhood playmate Julius Benedict
and became acquainted with a wildly eccentric young
French musician named Berlioz. On his way northward,
in Milan, Felix met Beethoven&rsquo;s friend, Dorothea von
Ertmann; also, Karl Mozart, whom he delighted by
playing some of his father&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>With his incredible dispatch he had managed to accomplish
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
a great amount of creative work in Italy,
despite his social and sight-seeing activities. He had
finished a version of the &ldquo;Hebrides&rdquo; Overture, had made
progress with his &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Italian&rdquo; Symphonies,
written a Psalm, several motets, the &ldquo;First Walpurgis
Night&rdquo; (later recast), piano pieces, songs. Returning
to Germany via Switzerland he stopped off in Munich
and gave a benefit concert on Oct. 17, 1831. It was for
this event that he composed his G minor Piano Concerto.
In a letter to his father Felix referred to it, somewhat
contemptuously, as &ldquo;a thing rapidly thrown off&rdquo;. It
has been assumed that Mendelssohn may have had Paris
in mind composing this concerto. At any rate, the first
three months of 1832 found him once more in the
French capital, where he made new musical acquaintances.
One of these was the conductor, Habeneck; others,
Chopin, Liszt, Ole Bull, Franchomme. Yet Mendelssohn
found it difficult, even as he had earlier, to adjust himself
to some musical insensibilities of Paris. He was appalled
on one occasion to learn that his own Octet
was given in a church at a funeral mass commemorating
Beethoven. &ldquo;I can scarcely imagine anything more absurd
than a priest at the altar and my Scherzo going on&rdquo;,
he wrote his parents. Habeneck, who had him play at
one of the Conservatoire concerts, wanted to produce at
one of them the &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; Symphony, which Felix
had composed in 1830 for the tercentenary of the
Augsburg Confession. The performance never took place;
the orchestra disliked the work, finding it &ldquo;too learned,
too much fugato, too little melody&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Were these objections wholly unfounded? Irrespective
of what passed in those days for excessive &ldquo;learning&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Reformation Symphony&rdquo; is, in good truth, a stodgy
work, far more willed than inspired. The most engaging
thing in it is the citation in the first movement of that
&ldquo;Dresden Amen&rdquo; formula, which half a century later
Wagner was to employ in &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo;. Strangely enough,
some pages of the symphony sound like Schumann without
the latter&rsquo;s melodic invention. It is only just to point
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
out that the composer himself came to detest it, declared
it was the one work of his he would gladly burn and
refused to permit its publication.</p>
<p>Zelter died not long after Goethe and the Singakademie
found itself without a head. Mendelssohn seemed his
old teacher&rsquo;s logical successor and he would gladly have
accepted the post. But many of the old ladies of the
chorus did not take kindly to the idea of &ldquo;singing under
a Jewish boy&rdquo;. When it came to a vote Felix was defeated
by a large majority and one Karl Rungenhagen
installed as Zelter&rsquo;s successor. Rather tactlessly the Mendelssohns
resigned their membership in a body. Felix&rsquo;s
popularity in Berlin was not improved by the situation,
despite the family&rsquo;s wealth and influence. He said little
but the wound rankled, somewhat as happened earlier
over Berlin&rsquo;s rejection of &ldquo;Camacho&rsquo;s Wedding&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The C&auml;cilienverein, of Frankfort, asked the composer
to write an oratorio based on St. Paul. But if Mendelssohn
was unable to oblige at once, the seed was planted
and, in proper season, was to take root. Late in 1832 a
different kind of offer came from another quarter. The
Lower Rhine Festival was to be given in D&uuml;sseldorf the
spring of 1833. Would Felix conduct it?</p>
<p>The D&uuml;sseldorf commission was accepted and as soon
as preliminaries were arranged Felix was off to his
&ldquo;smoky nest&rdquo; once more. He had now completed his
&ldquo;Italian&rdquo; Symphony and placed it, along with his &ldquo;Calm
Sea and Prosperous Voyage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trumpet&rdquo; Overtures
at the disposal of the London Philharmonic. The Symphony
was produced on May 13, 1833. To this day it
remains one of the most translucent, gracious and limpid
creations imaginable&mdash;&ldquo;kid glove music&rdquo;, as some have
called it, but no less inspired for its gentility. Is it really
Italian, despite the Neapolitan frenzy of its &ldquo;Saltarello&rdquo;
finale? Is it not rather Grecian, like so much else in
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s art, with its incorruptible symmetry and
its Mediterranean <i>limpidezza</i>? Where has Mendelssohn
instrumented with more luminous clarity than in the first
three movements? The second one, a kind of Pilgrims&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
March, has none of the sentimentality which wearies in
some of the composer&rsquo;s <i>adagios</i>. The third, in its weaving
grace is, one might say, Mendelssohnian in the loveliest
sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Felix&rdquo;, as he was freely called, returned to Germany
for the D&uuml;sseldorf festival, which began on May
26 (Whitsuntide), 1833. Abraham Mendelssohn came
from Berlin to witness his son&rsquo;s triumph. The D&uuml;sseldorf
directorate was so pleased with everything that Mendelssohn
was asked to take charge &ldquo;of all the public and
private musical establishments of the town&rdquo; for a period
of three years. He was to have a three months&rsquo; leave of
absence each summer. &ldquo;One thing I especially like about
Felix&rsquo;s position is that, while so many have titles without
an office he will have a real office without a title&rdquo;, declared
the father.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the projected &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo; oratorio was more
and more filling its composer&rsquo;s mind and probably a large
part of it had already taken shape. As a matter of fact, he
looked upon his appointment at D&uuml;sseldorf less as a lucrative
engagement than as furnishing him an opportunity
&ldquo;for securing quiet and leisure for composition&rdquo;. Still,
he gave much attention to his duties, particularly those
in connection with church music &ldquo;for which no appropriate
epithet exists for that hitherto given here&rdquo;. In an
evil hour he had lightly agreed to take charge of the activities
at the theatre. It was not long before he regretted it.
Felix was never made to cope with the intrigues and irritations
of an opera house. On the opening night, at a performance
of &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo;, there was a riot in the
theatre and the curtain had to be lowered four times before
the middle of the first act. Associated with him was
Karl Immermann, with whom he had previously negotiated
about an opera book based on Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo;.
In D&uuml;sseldorf their relations became strained and
eventually Felix, in disgust, gave up his theatrical labours
and the salary that went with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo; was not so swiftly completed as the composer
may have hoped from his D&uuml;sseldorf &ldquo;leisure&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
(actually, it was finished only in 1836). But he could
not, from a creative standpoint, have been called an idler.
To the D&uuml;sseldorf period of 1833-34 belong the Overture
&ldquo;The Beautiful Melusine&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Rondo Brillant&rdquo; in
E flat, for piano and orchestra, the A minor Capriccio
for piano, the concert aria, &ldquo;Infelice&rdquo;, a revision of the
&ldquo;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&rdquo; Overture and not
a little else. The &ldquo;Melusine&rdquo; is one of his most poetic
and mellifluous inspirations, with its lovely &ldquo;wave figure&rdquo;
based on the arpeggiated form of the F major chord and
so intimately related to one of the Rhine motives in
Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ring&rdquo;. How Mendelssohn managed to accomplish
so much without slighting in any way his social
obligations, his watercolor painting, his excursions here
and there is hard to grasp.</p>
<p>In good truth, the enormous productivity which his
unremitting facility encouraged, his piano playing and
conducting, his incessant travels were subtly undermining
his system. The effects did not make themselves
felt at once but they contributed, bit by bit, to a nervous
irritation that grew on him. Whether or not he appreciated
that he came from a stock which, though healthy,
bore in itself the seeds of an early death he made no effort
to spare himself and never hesitated to burn the candle at
both ends. The Mendelssohns had delicate blood vessels,
they were predisposed to apoplexy. Abraham may or
may not have been forewarned when, on returning to
Berlin from D&uuml;sseldorf with his wife and Felix, he fell ill
at Cassel. For a time his sight had been failing and he
was becoming an outright hypochondriac. The more difficult
he grew the more intense was the filial devotion
Felix lavished on him.</p>
<p>Early in 1835 the composer received from Dr. Conrad
Schleinitz a communication which showed that his good
fortunes were to remain constant. It was nothing less
than an invitation to accept the post of conductor of the
Gewandhaus concerts in Leipzig. Mendelssohn was flattered
but experience had made him canny. Before giving
his reply he demanded categorical answers to a number
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
of questions touching artistic and business matters.
Everything was settled to his satisfaction and, with his
parents, his sisters and their husbands, he returned to the
Rhineland to conduct another Lower Rhine Festival, this
time to be held in Cologne.</p>
<p>If there was one place which promised to provide as
happy a home for Felix as London did it was Leipzig.
The atmosphere of the town was a spiritual balm after
the hectic life of D&uuml;sseldorf. Who shall say that it was not
with symbolic intent that the newcomer led off his activities
with his own &ldquo;Calm Sea&rdquo; Overture and Beethoven&rsquo;s
serene Fourth Symphony? And although Felix&rsquo;s circle of
musical friendships sometimes appeared boundless he
now came into intimate contact with certain choice and
master spirits of the age whom he might otherwise have
known only casually. An early visitor at Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
new home was Chopin and in a letter to his parents in
Berlin he writes of his pleasure in being able to associate
once more with a thorough musician. One of those to
whom Felix introduced Chopin was Clara Wieck, then
only sixteen. On October 3&mdash;a historic date, as it proved&mdash;another
stepped into the charmed circle, Robert Schumann,
to whom Mendelssohn was to become a god.
&ldquo;Felix Meritis entered&rdquo;, wrote Schumann describing in
his best Florestan vein the first Gewandhaus concert. &ldquo;In
a moment a hundred hearts flew to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light-heartedly Felix accompanied his sister, Rebecka,
and her husband on a trip to the family homestead in
Berlin. There seemed to be even more gayety than usual
and a greater amount of extempore music-making for the
entertainment of the father. A short time after he had
returned to Leipzig in great good humor he was shocked
by the entrance of his brother-in-law, Hensel, with the
news that Abraham Mendelssohn had died in his sleep
on Nov. 19, 1835. The blow was heavy but Felix, once
he regained control of himself, endured it with fortitude.
Yet the loss of the father whom, to the last, he idolized
marked the first great sorrow of his life. To Pastor Schubring
he wrote: &ldquo;The only thing now is to do one&rsquo;s duty&rdquo;.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
It sounds like a copy-book maxim but it was undoubtedly
sincere. His specific &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in this case was to complete
the still unfinished &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo;, about which Abraham had
been ceaselessly inquiring.</p>
<p>Logically the oratorio should have been given by the
C&auml;cilienverein, in Frankfort, which had originally commissioned
it. But Schelble, the director of the Society,
was ill. So the premiere took place at the D&uuml;sseldorf
Festival of 1836. Klingemann, who sent an account of it
to the London &ldquo;Musical News&rdquo;, said that the performance
was &ldquo;glorious&rdquo;, that he &ldquo;had never heard such
choral singing&rdquo;. The composer himself was more restrained.
&ldquo;Many things gave me great pleasure, but on
the whole I learned a great deal&rdquo;. He had come to the
conclusion that the work, like so many of his others,
would benefit by a careful overhauling. And in due
course he set about recasting and improving. He had
grounds for satisfaction. If &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo; does not reach
some of the prouder dramatic heights of the later &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo;
it is a woeful error to underrate it.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn felt he owed it to his old friend, Schelble,
to take over the direction of the C&auml;cilienverein; so he
cancelled a Swiss vacation he had planned and went to
Frankfort. He hobnobbed with the Hiller family and
with Rossini, who happened to be in Germany for a few
days. But more important, he made the acquaintance of
C&eacute;cile Charlotte Sophie Jeanrenaud, daughter of a clergyman
of the French Reformed Church. C&eacute;cile&rsquo;s widowed
mother was herself still so young and attractive that for a
time people thought that she, rather than the 17 year-old
girl, was the cause of Felix&rsquo;s frequent visits. Fanny Hensel
had latterly been urging her brother to marry, alarmed
by his somewhat morbid state of mind. C&eacute;cile Jeanrenaud,
according to Wilhelm Hensel, complemented Felix
most harmoniously; still, &ldquo;she was not conspicuously
clever, witty, learned, profound or talented, though restful
and refreshing&rdquo;. Mendelssohn was not the man to let
his affections stampede him into marriage. So before an
engagement might be announced he accompanied his
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
friend, the painter Schadow, on a month&rsquo;s journey to the
Dutch seaside resort, Scheveningen, there to take long
walks on the beach, think things over and come to an
understanding with himself. Only then did he settle
definitely upon the step.</p>
<p>The marriage took place in Frankfort on March 28,
1837, and the couple went for a honeymoon to Freiburg
and the Black Forest. The wedding trip was followed
by a seemingly unending round of social obligations.
Nevertheless, Mendelssohn found time for considerable
work. Then a summons to England, to produce &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo;
at the Birmingham Festival (the oratorio had already
been given in Liverpool and by the Sacred Harmonic Society
in London). If only &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo; had been the whole
story! But Mendelssohn had enormous miscellaneous
programs to conduct, he played the organ, he was soloist
in his own D minor Piano Concerto. Back in Leipzig he
settled with his wife in a house in Lurgenstein&rsquo;s Garden,
welcomed Fanny, who saw for the first time those &ldquo;beautiful
eyes&rdquo; of C&eacute;cile, about which she had heard so much,
and greeted the arrival of a son, named Carl Wolfgang
Paul. The Gewandhaus concerts flourished as never
before. Felix produced much Bach, Handel and Beethoven;
also he had many of those typical German &ldquo;prize-crowned&rdquo;
scores of sickening mediocrity to perform. Musical
friends came and went&mdash;Schumann, Clara Wieck,
Liszt, Berlioz, and a young Englishman, Sterndale Bennet,
whom both Mendelssohn and Schumann praised to a
degree which we, today, can scarcely grasp. Small wonder
that, amidst all this unmerciful and never-ending ferment
Felix occasionally became worried about his health.
&ldquo;I am again suffering from deafness in one ear, pains in
my throat, headaches and so on&rdquo;, he wrote to Hiller.
Occasionally his friends made fun of his intense love of
sleep. One can only regret that he did not yield to it
more often!</p>
<p>We must pass over Mendelssohn&rsquo;s unending labours in
Leipzig, at a number of German festivals and in England
(where his new &ldquo;symphony-cantata&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Hymn of
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
Praise&rdquo;, was featured) to follow him once more to Berlin.
In 1840 Frederick William IV had become King of
Prussia. One of the pet cultural schemes of the monarch
was an Academy of Arts, to be divided into classes of
painting, sculpture, architecture and music. For the direction
of the last department the king wanted none
but Mendelssohn. Hence much correspondence passed
between Mendelssohn and the bureaucrats concerning the
royal scheme. Time had not softened his hostility toward
officialdom, particularly of the Berlin brand. However, he
bound himself for a year, took up residence on the Leipziger
Strasse once more, submitted his scheme for the
Musical Academy and received the title &ldquo;Kapellmeister to
the King of Prussia&rdquo; along with a very tolerable salary.
Frederick William wished, among other things, to revive
certain antique Greek tragedies, beginning with Sophocles&rsquo;
&ldquo;Antigone&rdquo;. The scheme led to exhaustive discussions
between Mendelssohn and the poet, Tieck, touching
the nature of the music to be written. In due course there
followed &ldquo;Oedipus at Colonos&rdquo;. The kind of music
needed was, as it will probably remain forever, a
problem defying solution. What Mendelssohn finally
wrote turned out, by and large, to be adequate Mendelssohnian
commonplace.</p>
<p>Greek tragedy was not the only sort of dramatic entertainment
projected by the King of Prussia. Racine&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Athalie&rdquo;, Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; likewise took their place on the royal
schedule. Nothing came of &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; so far as
Mendelssohn was concerned. But he fashioned some excellent
music for Racine&rsquo;s play and enriched the &ldquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; with an incidental score which
may well be inseparably associated with the immortal
fantasy to the end of time. There was, to be sure, no
need for a new overture, Felix having written the most
perfect conceivable one in his boyhood. But a dozen
other numbers, long or short, were called for and, with the
most consummate ease and soaring inspiration, Mendelssohn
produced them. They are exquisitely delicate settings
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s elfin songs and choruses, a &ldquo;funeral
march&rdquo; of extravagant grotesqueness, clownish dance
music, a flashing Intermezzo, depicting the pursuit of
the lovers through the wood, and other &ldquo;background&rdquo;
pieces. The memorable concert numbers, however, are
the incomparable Scherzo&mdash;perhaps the most priceless
of all the famous scherzi the composer wrote; the romantic
Nocturne, with its rapturous horn revery, and the
triumphant Wedding March, a ringing processional
which, in reality, belongs to all mankind rather than to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s stage lovers.</p>
<p>The royal scheme for the Academy was not advancing
and presently the plans began to gather dust in official
pigeon holes. Frederick William, seeing the turn things
were taking, appointed his Kapellmeister the head of
the music performed in the Dom. The Singakademie,
conscience-stricken over its earlier treatment of the composer,
now made him an honorary member. For all that,
Mendelssohn was not fundamentally happier in Berlin
than he had been previously. Fortunately he had not
resigned his Gewandhaus post when he left Leipzig and
it had again become more desirable to him than all the
royal distinctions Berlin could confer. He had added
greatly to his creative output during this period (for one
thing he had rewritten the &ldquo;Walpurgisnacht&rdquo; and finished
the &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo; Symphony) and now he was occupied with
plans for a new music school in Leipzig&mdash;the famous
Conservatory, first domiciled in the Gewandhaus. In
January, 1843, its prospectus was issued. The faculty was
to include men like the theorist Moritz Hauptmann, the
violinist, Ferdinand David, the organist, Carl Becker and
finally, as professors of composition and piano, Schumann
and Mendelssohn. Felix was not really overjoyed at
the prospect of pedagogical drudgery; yet to Hiller he
wrote &ldquo;I shall have to go ... three or four times a week
and talk about 6-4 chords ... I am quite willing to do
this for the love of the cause, because I believe it to be a
good cause&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Quite as peacefully as her husband, Leah Mendelssohn
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
died shortly before Christmas, 1842. Felix grieved, if he
was perhaps less stricken than by the passing of his
father. Doubtless he felt once more that nothing remained
but &ldquo;to do his duty&rdquo;&mdash;and these duties were unsparing
and seemed to grow more numerous and complex as the
years went by. One sometimes questions if, truly, the
labors of a Bach, a Haydn and a Mozart were more
ramified and unending than Mendelssohn&rsquo;s&mdash;even if he
had no need to toil in order to keep the wolf from the
door!</p>
<p>As time passed the Mendelssohn craze in England grew
steadily by what it fed on and it was only natural that
Felix should find himself repeatedly in London. He alluded
to his successes and to the intensity of his welcome
by his British friends as &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo;, and declared himself
completely stunned by it all. &ldquo;I think I must have been
applauded for ten minutes and, after the first concert,
almost trampled upon!&rdquo; The young Queen Victoria was
quite as effusive as her subjects. She invited the composer
to Buckingham Palace and was graciousness itself. He
played her seven of his &ldquo;Songs Without Words&rdquo;, then the
&ldquo;Serenade&rdquo;, then Fantasies on &ldquo;Rule Brittania&rdquo;, &ldquo;L&uuml;tzows
Wilde Jagd&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaudeamus Igitur&rdquo;. It was by
no means the only time British royalty was to show him
favor. Up to the year of his death Victoria and Albert
were to shower distinctions upon him, to treat him, as
it were, like one of the family.</p>
<p>Doubtless this is as good an opportunity as another to
particularize. On one memorable occasion the Queen
sang to his accompaniment and both she and her Consort
scrambled to pick up sheets of music that had fallen off
the piano. On another, the sovereign asked if there were
&ldquo;anything she could do to please Dr. Mendelssohn!&rdquo;.
There was, indeed! Could Her Majesty let him for a
few moments visit the royal nursery? Nothing Dr. Mendelssohn
could have wished would have delighted Victoria
more! Unceremoniously leading the way she showed him
all the mysteries of the place, opened closets, wardrobes
and cupboards and in a few minutes the two were deep
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
in a discussion of infants&rsquo; underwear, illnesses and diets.
Mendelssohn and C&eacute;cile&rsquo;s own family was growing by
this time and might easily profit by the example of
Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>The Queen found so much delight in the &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo;
Symphony that the composer promptly dedicated it to
her. But for that matter, England could scarcely hear
enough of it. Whether or not one ranks it as high as the
&ldquo;Italian&rdquo; the A minor unquestionably represents the
other half of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s chief symphonic accomplishment.
The question to what degree it embodies Scottish
elements or any appreciable degree of local colour is less
important than the fact that it is strong, impassioned
music, informed with a ruggedness and conflict unlike the
sunnier A major. There is a mood of tumult and drama in
the first movement, whose closing subject is a definite
prefigurement of the songful theme in the opening <i>allegro</i>
of Brahms&rsquo; Second Symphony. The Scherzo begins with
a sort of jubilant extension of the Irish folksong &ldquo;The
Minstrel Boy&rdquo; and the buoyant movement, as a whole, is
full of tingling life. On the other hand, the <i>Adagio</i> undoubtedly
displays a weakness characterizing so many of
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s slow movements&mdash;it is sentimental rather
than searching or personal, since with Mendelssohn grief
is &ldquo;only a recollection of former joys&rdquo;. Yet the <i>finale</i> is
superbly vital and the sonorous coda with which it concludes
has a regal stateliness and a bardic ring.</p>
<p>Whatever honours, labours, irritations and unending
travels and fatigues were his portion on the Continent
(and they seemed steadily to increase) it was to England
that Mendelssohn continually turned to refresh his spirit.
Not that his toil there was lighter or his welcome less
hectic! But there was something about it all that filled
his soul. People presented him with medals, commemorative
addresses, they organized torchlight processions,
sang serenades&mdash;and almost killed him with kindness.
Yet we are told that &ldquo;he never enjoyed himself more
than when in the midst of society, music, fun and excitement&rdquo;.
&ldquo;A mad, most extraordinary mad time ...
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
never in bed till half-past one ... for three weeks together
not a single hour to myself in any one day ... I
have made more music in these two months than elsewhere
in two years&rdquo;. He ordered a huge &ldquo;Baum Kuchen&rdquo;
from Berlin (though usually, Grove informs us, he
made no great ado over &ldquo;the products of the kitchen&rdquo;,
his chief enjoyments being milk rice and cherry pie).
His power of recovery after fatigue was said to be &ldquo;as
great as his powers of enjoyment&rdquo;. With it all &ldquo;he was
never dissipated&rdquo;; the only stimulants he indulged in
were &ldquo;music, society and boundless good spirits&rdquo;. Seemingly
it never occurred to him that even a strong constitution
can have too much of these.</p>
<p>When Mendelssohn became conductor of the Gewandhaus
Orchestra he appointed as his concertmaster his old
friend, the violinist Ferdinand David, who it will be recalled
was born in the same house at Hamburg. As early
as 1838 Felix had written to David: &ldquo;I should like to
write a violin concerto for you next winter. One in E
minor runs through my head the beginning of which
gives me no peace&rdquo;. Actually, he had tried his hand at
a violin concerto accompanied by a string orchestra during
his boyhood though this was only a kind of student
effort. But David took the promise seriously and when
nothing came of it for a time determined not to let
Mendelssohn forget it.</p>
<p>Fully five years elapsed before the composer finished
in its first form the concerto which to this day stands
with the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms and
Tchaikovsky as the most enduring of the repertoire. For
the various technical problems of the solo part and even
of the orchestration David was constantly at the disposal
of his friend. He offered numberless hints of the utmost
value and is even believed to have shaped the cadenza
in the first movement as we know it. Even after the
score was presumably complete David advised further
changes and improvements, so that the work did not
acquire its conclusive aspect till February, 1845. On the
following March 13 it was performed by David at a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Gewandhaus concert. Not under the composer&rsquo;s direction,
however. The latter was in Frankfort, in poor health
and greatly worn out, and had no stomach for the excitements
of another premiere. The conductor was his
Danish friend, Niels W. Gade. It was not till two weeks
later that David apologized by letter for his delay in
describing the triumph of the concerto. &ldquo;The work
pleased extraordinarily well and was unanimously declared
to be one of the most beautiful compositions of
its kind&rdquo;. In more than a century there has been no
reason to alter this verdict.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s constitution may have been resilient
and his recuperative powers as remarkable as his friends
imagined, but it should have been clear to the more far-sighted
among them that sooner or later these incessant
journeys, this interminable business of composing, conducting,
playing, teaching, organizing must exact a stern
penalty. It is not surprising that, at the time the violin
concerto was given in Leipzig, he preferred to remain
in Frankfort with his wife and the children (who had
gone through quite a siege of juvenile illnesses) and
make a serious effort to rest. But truly efficacious rest is
a habit that must be systematically cultivated. Felix did
not possess it in his earlier years, nor could he acquire it
now when overwork promised to consume the sensitive
fibre of his being.</p>
<p>Yet in the summer of 1845 he was approached once
more with a scheme of major dimensions. The Birmingham
Festival Committee offered him the direction of a
festival planned for August, 1846, and asked him to &ldquo;compose
a performance&rdquo;&mdash;in this case, a new oratorio. He
was sensible enough to refuse to conduct the whole
festival but he was willing to produce such an oratorio,
even if only ten months remained to compose most of
the score and rehearse the performance.</p>
<p>The prophet Elijah had engrossed his imagination as
an oratorio subject ever since he had completed &ldquo;St.
Paul&rdquo; and discussed the new work with his friend Klingemann.
In 1839 he had corresponded with Pastor Schubring
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
about a text and he had even made rudimentary
sketches for the music. Other obligations crowded it out
of his mind. Now, six years later, he returned to it.
He realized that the time was short but his heart was
set on &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo;, although he was prudent enough to
suggest some other work if the oratorio should by any
chance strike a snag.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn could write fast&mdash;too fast, perhaps, for
his artistic good. Still, &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; was a heart-breaking
assignment. It is only just to say that he realized certain
inadequacies of the first version and revised not a little
of the score after hearing it. His labours were complicated
by the lengthy correspondence he was obliged to carry
on with William Bartholomew, the translator. Mendelssohn
insisted on a close adherence to the King James
version of the Bible, with the result that the English
words often conform neither to the accent nor the sense
of the German originals. The choice of a soprano offered
another problem. The composer wanted Jenny Lind,
whom he admired extravagantly (he loved her F sharp
and the note seems to have haunted his mind when he
wrote the air, &ldquo;Hear Ye, Israel&rdquo;). But Jenny Lind was
unavailable and he had to be satisfied with a Maria
Caradori-Allan, whom he disliked and whose singing he
afterwards described as &ldquo;so pretty, so pleasing, so elegant
and at the same time so flat, so unintelligent, so
soulless that the music acquired a sort of amiable expression
about which I could go mad&rdquo;. Be all of which
as it may, Caradori-Allan was paid as much for singing
in the first &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; as Mendelssohn was for composing
it! The precious creature actually told him at a rehearsal
that &ldquo;Hear Ye, Israel&rdquo; was &ldquo;not a lady&rsquo;s song,&rdquo; and asked
him to have it transposed and otherwise altered.</p>
<p>However, the first performance in Birmingham, Aug.
26, 1846, was a triumph for the composer though, to be
candid, the uncritical adulation of the audience had
settled the verdict in advance. The report of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
boyhood friend, Julius Benedict, is typical: &ldquo;The
noble Town Hall was crowded at an early hour of that
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
forenoon with a brilliant and eagerly expectant audience....
Every eye had long been directed toward the conductor&rsquo;s
desk, when, at half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock, a
deafening shout from the band and chorus announced
the approach of the great composer. The reception he
met from the assembled thousands ... was absolutely
overwhelming; whilst the sun, emerging at that moment,
seemed to illumine the vast edifice in honour of the
bright and pure being who stood there, the idol of all
beholders&rdquo;!</p>
<p>It enhances one&rsquo;s respect for the artistic probity of
Mendelssohn that he preserved his balance. He evaluated
his work critically, carefully modified or enlarged it and
obliged Bartholomew to make a quantity of changes in
the English text. On April 16, 1847, he conducted the
revised version in the first of four performances by the
Sacred Harmonic Society in Exeter Hall, London. On
April 23 the Queen and the Prince Consort heard the
work. Albert wrote in the book of words and sent to
Mendelssohn a dedication: &ldquo;To the Noble Artist who,
surrounded by the Baal-worship of debased art, has been
able by his genius and science to preserve faithfully, like
another Elijah, the Worship of True Art, and once more
to accustom our ears, amid the whirl of empty frivolous
sounds, to the pure tones of sympathetic feeling and
legitimate harmony: to the Great Master, who makes us
conscious of the unity of his conception, through the
whole maze of his creation, from the soft whispering to
the mighty raging of the elements. Inscribed in grateful
remembrance by</p>
<p><span class="lr">Albert&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>It was a fitting climax to Mendelssohn&rsquo;s tenth visit to
England&mdash;in some ways his most memorable, in any case
his last.</p>
<p>Before Mendelssohn left London he paid a farewell
visit to Buckingham Palace. He had a mysterious presentiment
that he must leave hurriedly. Friends pressed
him to remain in England a little longer. &ldquo;Ah! I wish I
may not already have stayed too long here! One more
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
week of this unremitting fatigue and I should be killed
outright&rdquo;. He was manifestly ill. Fate caught up with him
at Frankfort. Scarcely had he arrived in a state of prostration
when he abruptly learned that his sister, Fanny
Hensel, had died while at the piano conducting a choir
rehearsal. With a shriek, Felix collapsed. The shock of
the news and the violence of his fall on hearing it
brought about a rupture of one of those delicate cerebral
blood vessels which had caused so many deaths in
the Mendelssohn family.</p>
<p>In a measure he recovered. He went to Baden-Baden
and later to Switzerland. He wrote letters, sketched and
still composed. He greeted friends from England, he
learned that London and Liverpool wanted new symphonies
and cantatas. This time he did nothing about it.
When he, finally, returned in September to Leipzig, he
seemed to feel better, though Moscheles, meeting him,
was frightened to see how he had aged and changed.
On Oct. 9, while visiting his friend, the singer Livia
Frege, in connection with some Lieder he planned to
publish, he was seized with a chill. He hurried home
and was put to bed, tortured by violent headaches. He
had planned to go to Vienna late in the month to
conduct &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; with Jenny Lind as the soprano. Of
this there could now be no question. On Nov. 3, 1847 he
suffered another stroke and lay, it is claimed, unconscious,
though Ferdinand David says that, till ten in the evening,
&ldquo;he screamed frightfully, then made noises as if he
heard the sounds of drums and trumpets.... During the
following day the pains seemed to cease, but his face
was that of a dying man&rdquo;. Some time between 9:15 and
9:30 in the evening he ceased to breathe. He was exactly
three months short of 39 years old. Grouped about
the bed were his wife, his brother Paul, David, Schleinitz
and Moscheles. &ldquo;Through Fanny&rsquo;s death our family was
destroyed&rdquo;, wrote Paul Mendelssohn to Klingemann;
&ldquo;through Felix&rsquo;s, it is annihilated&rdquo;! Leipzig was stunned
by the news. &ldquo;It is lovely weather here&rdquo;, wrote a young
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
English music student, &ldquo;but an awful stillness prevails;
we feel as if the king were dead....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posthumously, Mendelssohn&rsquo;s fate seemed like a strange
reversal of his supreme idol&rsquo;s, Bach. Bach passed into
long eclipse, then, largely through Mendelssohn&rsquo;s heroic
efforts, underwent a miracle of resurrection which has
grown more overpowering clear down to our own time.
Mendelssohn, almost preposterously famous at his death,
was before very long pronounced outmoded, overrated,
virtually negligible. The whole history of music scarcely
shows a more violent backswing of the pendulum. To
take pleasure in any but a handful of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
works was for decades to lose caste, if not to invite
ignominy. By 1910&mdash;just about the centenary of his birth&mdash;the
low water-mark of derogation had been reached.</p>
<p>Now, a hundred years after his death, a most definite
reaction is in progress. Is it not, rather, a salutary readjustment
than a mere reaction? If Mendelssohn&rsquo;s poorer
works have not endured is it not better so? Struggle
and suffering might, indeed, have lent a deeper undertone
to his songs or enabled his adagios, in old Sir George
Grove&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;to draw tears where now they only give
a saddened pleasure. But let us take a man as we have
him. Surely there is enough conflict and violence in
life and in art. When we want to be made unhappy
we can turn to others. It is well in these agitated modern
days to be able to point to one perfectly balanced nature
in whose life, whose letters and whose music alike all
is at once manly and refined, clever and pure, brilliant
and solid. For the enjoyment of such shining heights of
goodness we may well forego for once the depths of
misery and sorrow&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And Grove&rsquo;s words taken on an added poignancy precisely
because they were <i>not</i> spoken of an epoch as
grievous as our own!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
